### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Hip-Hop Lyrics Generator
+ This project is conducted by Zidi Hong

+ Project summary: The purpose of this data story is mimicking how a lyrics generator works in somehow to write hip-hop lyrics. During the process, I use topic modeling to choose the topic and words in my lyrics, and use sentiment analysis to set the emotion type. Then I decide the lyrics length. Finally I can get a demo of hip-hop lyrics.

+ The following questions will be solved:

+ 1.How to choose a topic and related words?

+ 2.How to choose emotion type in your lyrics?

+ 3.How to decide the length of the lyrics?
